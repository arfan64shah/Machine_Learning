    "### Part 1: Critique this plan (5 points)\n",
    "1\\. Your CIO invited her buddy from Mountain Kol consulting to propose a project using data mining to improve the targeting of the new service that you have been a principal in developing. The service has been quite successful so far, being marketed over the last 6 months via your ingenious, and very inexpensive, word-of-mouth campaign. You've already garnered a pretty large customer base without any targeting, and you've been seeing this success as your best stepping stone to bigger and better things in the firm. \n",
    "\n",
    "After some reflection, you've decided that your best course of action is to play a key role in ensuring the success of this data mining project as well. You agree with your CIO's statement in a meeting with Mountain Kol, that accurate targeting might cost-effectively expand your audience substantially to consumers that word-of-mouth would not reach. You accept that what Mountain Kol says about the characteristics of your service is accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on what we have covered in class, identify the four most serious weaknesses/flaws in this abridged version of Mountain Kol's proposal, and suggest how to ameliorate them.  Your answer should be 4 bullet points, each comprising 2-4 sentences: 1-2 sentences stating each weakness, and 1-2 sentences suggesting a better alternative.  Maximal credit will be given when the 4 points are as independent as possible.\n",

    "1. First of all the description does not state how the model is being trained and tested. There is very less info about the training model. It is also quite ambiguous that which data is used to train and test the model. This can be resolved by explicitly stating how the model is being trained and tested. It should be trained and tested properly without any biasness.\n",
    "2. Secondly, it is stated that the model is being based on the demographics. Demographics can generate social biasness. It can select some specific race or population and will train the model based on it and while applying the model it will chose the customers of specific race and ethnicity. This can be overcome by training the model on all the races or instead of demographics other features should be selected to train the model.\n",
    "3. There is less infromation about the evaluation of the model. We don't know how good is the models accuray's. Statistical significance does not tell us about the accuracy rather it shows us how well the model is predicting. statistical significance can be result of chance as well.  We need to calculate the model's sensitivity, recall, accuracy, precision etc to know how effient is it. \n",
    "4. Moreover, it seems like the sample is not random which will result to biasness in the model. The model is based on the previous data of customers which makes it bias and not random. We can make it random by training model on random dataset which will rise the probability of reaching to more people. It is not the best idea to train model on only past data beacuse there might be new people who might be interested in the service. This will help in generalizability and identifiability of new customers.\n",
    "5. The significance of variable/features is also not mentioned. If we know the significance of all variables and their correlation then it would be helpful to reach to many customers. We should find the variables significance and correlation to train the model properly.}}$"

    "Unlike supervised learning, where we have the ground truth to evaluate the model's performance, clustering analysis being unsupervised lacks a strong evaluation metric to compare the results of various clustering algorithms. Furthermore, because kmeans takes k as an input and does not learn it from data, there is no correct answer in terms of how many clusters we should have in each case. In some cases, domain knowledge and intuition can aid, but this is not always the case. Because clusters are employed in downstream modeling, we can use the cluster-predict methodology to assess how well the models are doing based on different K clusters.\n",
    "We can use ELbow method to know about the number of clusters which will tell us how the data is spread. In the above graph we can see that there are two distinct clusters. One is green and other is yellow. the green cluster is very dense and there seems to be very less variance but in the yellow cluster there is high variance.\n",
    "Although the graph does not give us discrete info about the data, still it gives us a sense that there can be two clusters which is similar to our original data where there are two catogries in our target variable: 0 and 1. The Elbow method has calculated the right number of clusters as in our target variable there are only two classes 0 and 1. 0 represents the income <=50K and 1 represents >50K.  "
